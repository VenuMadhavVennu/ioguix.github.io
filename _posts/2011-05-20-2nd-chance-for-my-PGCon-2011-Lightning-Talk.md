I'm proud to announce I'm the only one that couldn't finish his Lightning talk
on time this year.

Someone had to do it to justify Magnus work as a speaker cutter after 5min, so
I picked the job :)

Here is your second chance to watch my
[lightning talk slides](http://www.dalibo.org/lightning_sur_pgshark) online. 

Too bad I hadn't time to explain how I wanted to kill pgfouine and how a
`Replay` script on top of pgShark might be awesome for benchmarking and testing
purpose...

Hopefully I'll be able to make a longer talk at [pgconf.eu](http://2011.pgconf.eu/) !

Gleu: I know, you warned me :-)
