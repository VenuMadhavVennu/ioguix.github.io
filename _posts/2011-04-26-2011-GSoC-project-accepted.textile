p. Leonardo's project has been accepted for the GSoC 2011 today!

p. Knowing a bit Leonardo, I'm sure he will make everything possible to finish this project, or going as far as he can.  One thing to keep in mind about Leonardo and that I learned a bit late last year: as a Brazilian student, he was actually still studying at school while working for the GSoC 2010!

p. Moreover, Leonardo kept sending some small comments and contributions *out of the GSoC* during the year.  This is in my opinion the best thing about the GSoC: making students meet some FOSS communities, get used to it, team working and turning them into real new contributors.

p. ...but this year, he will have two mentors to convince! Both "Andreas Scherbaum":http://andreas.scherbaum.la/blog/ and me will tutor on this project, helping him and discussing the code on ppa-dev and irc://irc.freenode.net/#phppgadmin.

p. It will be the first contributions of Andreas Scherbaum to PPA and I'm really looking forward having some fresh eyes and manpower on the project!
