p. Some days or week ago now, I released a new website for phpPgAdmin.

p. Goals were to refresh a bit its old fashion style, but most importantly to move it to a wiki.  And "here it is":http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/doku.php!

p. I hope this will help us to keep the FAQ up-to-date, ease the website update and help us to centralize all project informations and data in one place (and outside of CVS !).

p. Thanks to the "postgresql.fr":http://postgresql.fr team for their work on hosting the beta version until sf.net finally update their hosting services.
