You will find the slides of my talk here: <http://www.dalibo.org/_media/2016-pgconfeu-paf.html.gz>

Demo's videos are embedded in the html file.

I just fixed some typos, French words and added a slide to describe the demo
environment.

The demos are actually based on the architecture described in the
documentation: <http://dalibo.github.io/PAF/Quick_Start-CentOS-7.html>

Any kind of feedback or contribution is welcomed.

Cheers!
