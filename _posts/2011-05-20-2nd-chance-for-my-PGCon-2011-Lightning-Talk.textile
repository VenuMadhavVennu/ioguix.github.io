p. I'm proud to announce I'm the only one that couldn't finish his Lightning talk on time this year.

p. Someone had to do it to justify Magnus work as a speaker cutter after 5min, so I picked the job :)

p. Here is your second chance to watch my "lightning talk slides":http://www.dalibo.org/lightning_sur_pgshark online.

p. Too bad I hadn't time to explain how I wanted to kill pgfouine and how a "Replay" script on top of pgShark might be awesome for benchmarking and testing purpose...

p. Hopefully I'll be able to make a longer talk at "pgconf.eu":http://2011.pgconf.eu/ !

p. Gleu: I know, you warned me :-)
