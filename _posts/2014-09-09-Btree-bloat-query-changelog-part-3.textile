h2. Changelog

p. Here are some fresh news about my previous work (see "part 1":{%post_url 2014-03-28-Playing-with-indexes-and-better-bloat-estimate%} and "part 2":{%post_url 2014-06-24-More-work-on-index-bloat-estimation-query%}) on a better Btree bloat query:

* add field @is_na@ to filter out indexes we can not estimate the bloat with "accuracy" (currently only indexes referencing a fields using the "name" type).
* better estimation for variable length types (varchar, text, bytea, ...). The query now try to consider their header part
* Three different queries depending on the PostgreSQL version:
** from 7.4 to 8.1: "https://gist.github.com/ioguix/5f60e24a77828078ff5f":https://gist.github.com/ioguix/5f60e24a77828078ff5f
** for 8.2: "https://gist.github.com/ioguix/0675875e2780b362ef28":https://gist.github.com/ioguix/0675875e2780b362ef28
** for 8.3 and more: "https://gist.github.com/ioguix/c29d5790b8b93bf81c27":https://gist.github.com/ioguix/c29d5790b8b93bf81c27
* ignore non-valid indexes for 8.2 and more


h2. Known issue

p. While working on table bloat (I will blog about that very soon), I found a large deviation on statistics on array types. I'm not sure how to handle correctly these animals' header yet.

p. Cheers and happy monitoring!
