p. Hi Clemens,

??the bytes output should be converted into human readable format (mb,gb,etc)??

p. The main purpose of this query is supervision, so I need raw values, but adding some more fields with human values is clearly useful.

??internal postgresql tables shouldn't be shown??

p. I decided to keep all the objects found in the database, even system ones. They can be removed easily by filtering out on the schemaname column if needed

??it should be sorted by most bloat first??

p. Agree with that, easy to add.

??See this index bloat query: "https://gist.github.com/gullevek/32881d6b4c5b1ed0135c":https://gist.github.com/gullevek/32881d6b4c5b1ed0135c (original here: "https://gist.github.com/mbanck/9976015":https://gist.github.com/mbanck/9976015)??

p. I know this query, it has been written by Josh Berkus based on my previous post. As I commented in his blog, I don't want to break compatibility with older release of PostgreSQL by using CTEs, just for human readability. I need it to monitor old releases (sadly, like 8.2, but even a 7.4!).

p. I'll update the query in my gist and this blog post with your comments.

p. Cheers,
