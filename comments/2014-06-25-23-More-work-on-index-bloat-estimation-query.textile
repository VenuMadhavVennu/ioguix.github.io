p. Interesting query, but there are several things that should be updated.

* the bytes output should be converted into human readable format (mb,gb,etc)
* internal postgresql tables shouldn't be shown
* it should be sorted by most bloat first

p. See this index bloat query: "https://gist.github.com/gullevek/32881d6b4c5b1ed0135c":https://gist.github.com/gullevek/32881d6b4c5b1ed0135c (original here: "https://gist.github.com/mbanck/9976015":https://gist.github.com/mbanck/9976015)
