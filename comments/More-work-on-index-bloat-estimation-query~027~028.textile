Hi Michael,

p. That's true. However, note that using @pg_stats@, you must make sure you are using a supervision role that is always granted to read all tables. If supervision role can not read some of the tables, the query just ignore them.

p. I updated my query (here and on github) based on your diff and just added a comment about that. See: "https://gist.github.com/ioguix/c29d5790b8b93bf81c27/revisions":https://gist.github.com/ioguix/c29d5790b8b93bf81c27/revisions

Thanks,
