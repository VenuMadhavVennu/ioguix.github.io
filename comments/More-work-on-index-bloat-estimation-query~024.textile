p. Re: name being a fixed length type

p. See the bottom of this page: "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-character.html":http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-character.html

p. I think 'name' being fixed length is a tradeoff of space vs. time in the system catalogs.  It gives predictable row layouts in the critical catalogs, for initialization, recovery, etc.
