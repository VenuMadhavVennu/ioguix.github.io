<p>I&#8217;ve played around with your tool and it works really well. One option that pgsniff has is that is allows you to specify a format where it prepends the log_line_prefix to the output, which is useful when you are trying to get timestamps or to feed the output file into pgfouine itself.</p>
<p>Nice work on this!</p>
