<p>@Peter Geoghegan: About backporting, my goal here was to give an easy trick on &lt;9.2 without patching/compiling code, just  pure and easy <span class="caps">SQL</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure to understand the first part of your comment. If you talk about current implementation of pg_stat_statement in 9.2+, I&#8217;m not sure regular expression are the best way to normalize queries on the fly. I believe a tokenizer would be very useful in PostgreSQL core, and discussed it in past. Normalizing would just be another useful feature from it.</p>
